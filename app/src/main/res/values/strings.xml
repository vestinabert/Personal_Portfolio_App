    <string name="affirmation1.1">The goal of a Social Media application is to connect people and facilitate communication, content sharing, and social interactions in a virtual environment. Users can create profiles, connect with friends, and follow celebrities or influencers. The application enables users to post updates, share multimedia content, interact through likes, and comments.</string>
    <string name="affirmation2.2">I created a platformer game “The Glitch” using Unity and C# programming language. This game will encourage players to enhance spatial visualisation, react quickly to problems, and solve them accordingly. It also teaches players about computer viruses and to be discerning in what they trust.</string>
    <string name="affirmation3.3">During my coursework, I created an electronic diary. It is a simple online platform designed to help a specific high school or school manage student information and academic records. The program allows storing information about students, teachers and courses. The project has a user-friendly interface and convenient features.</string>
    <string name="affirmation4.4">This tool can be used to create photo editing software, or it can assist visually impaired individuals in easily perceiving the content of an image. The project aims to create an application that performs the inversion operation by converting each pixel\'s color to its opposite color within the color spectrum. This will be achieved by reversing the brightness value of each pixel in every color channel.</string>
